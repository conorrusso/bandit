## [Unreleased]

---

## 2026-03-29 (evening)

### Changed — `(this commit)`
- **First-run setup prompt**: `bandit assess` with no config now prompts before starting — `s) Run setup now (recommended)` · `a) Assess anyway` · `q) Quit`. Default is `s`. Choosing setup runs the wizard inline, then continues into the assessment. Previously the tip appeared after the assessment had already run with default weights.
- **Welcome screen**: `bandit setup` added as the first entry in the COMMANDS panel with the label `Configure your profile (run this first)`. Cursor prompt updated to `New? Run bandit setup · Then bandit assess <vendor>`.

### Security — `53e54e6`
- **Atomic file writes** — history, cache, and setup progress files now write to a `.tmp` then atomically rename via `os.replace()`. Previously a crash or concurrent run mid-write could leave a truncated or empty JSON file, silently corrupting vendor history, the domain cache, or setup progress.
- **SSRF prevention** — added `_is_safe_url()` in `core/tools/discover.py` that blocks requests to loopback addresses (`127.x`, `localhost`), RFC-1918 private ranges (`10.x`, `192.168.x`, `172.x`), and cloud metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`). Applied at `head_request()` and `_tiny_get()`, which all network fetches flow through.
- **Exception narrowing** — `_load_history()` and `_load_cache()` changed from bare `except Exception` to `except (OSError, json.JSONDecodeError)`. `_save_cache()` gained a missing `try/except OSError` — previously an unhandled `OSError` (e.g. disk full) would crash an in-progress assessment.

### Removed — `8c0610c`
- Deleted `legacy/` directory (11 files, 2,418 lines) — the original n8n workflow prototype. Superseded entirely by the Bandit CLI. Local backup retained.

### Fixed — `a307d8e`
- `LICENSE`: copyright holder updated from `The Privacy Lens Contributors` to `Bandit Contributors`.
- `legacy/n8n/bandit-privacy.json`: CSS header string `◄ THE PRIVACY LENS ►` updated to `◄ BANDIT ►`.

### Changed — `3b2b3db`
- `bandit setup` section 6 fully rewritten to match spec:
  - `_ask_cadence()` — shows preset options per tier (HIGH: 6 months–2 years, MEDIUM: 1–5 years, LOW: 1 year–never) plus free-text custom day input. Defaults: HIGH=1 year, MEDIUM=2 years, LOW=one-time.
  - `_ask_triggers()` — shows all trigger options with `◉`/`◯` indicating per-tier defaults (HIGH: policy + breach + regulatory; MEDIUM: policy + breach; LOW: breach only). Enter accepts defaults; entering numbers replaces selection entirely; "Manual trigger only" returns empty list.
  - `_days_label()` — converts day counts to human-readable strings (`365` → `Every year`, `912` → `Every ~2 years`, `0` → `One time / on change`).
  - Confirmation screen now shows a reassessment schedule table with human-readable cadence and grouped trigger display.
  - `bandit setup --show` updated with same depth labels and cadence display.

### Added — `4db4088`
- Per-tier reassessment cadence replacing the single `reassess_cycle` setting. For each of HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW: configurable depth (`full` / `lightweight` / `scan` / `none`), cadence in days, and out-of-cycle triggers.
- `core/config.py`: `get_reassessment_config()` returns per-tier config with defaults. `write_config()` accepts `reassessment=` param and writes a top-level `reassessment:` YAML block. `_load_yaml_simple()` extended to handle 3-level nesting.
- `cli/report.py`: GRC section now reads config-driven cadence, shows assessment depth, re-assess date with cadence annotation, and active out-of-cycle triggers.
- `cli/main.py`: `--force` flag. Vendor history persisted to `~/.bandit/vendor-history.json` after each assessment. Cadence check warns and exits early if reassessment is not due; skips entirely for `depth: none`; bypassed with `--force`.

### Added — `ac42d6e`
- Setup wizard progress saved after every question to `~/.bandit/.setup_progress.json`. On next run, wizard offers to resume from last completed question or start over.
- `Ctrl+C` during setup prints `Setup paused at Q{n}/26. Run bandit setup to resume.` instead of crashing.
- `--reset` clears saved progress alongside the config file.

### Fixed — `6665672`
- Setup wizard crash on Q17 when user selected "Annual" or "On-change only" — `int("Annual")` raised `ValueError`. Fixed with index-based option map instead of string parsing. Same pattern applied to `risk_appetite` and `maturity` questions.

### Added — `2f905ca`
- Assessment scope honesty: D8 (DPA Completeness) excluded from the weighted average when only the public privacy policy is available. D2, D4, D5 flagged as partially assessed. Scope bar shown in HTML report header. `--dpa` placeholder flag added to `bandit assess`.

### Added — `f62a335`
- `bandit setup` — 26-question wizard that calculates dimension weights based on regulatory environment and data risk profile. Saves to `bandit.config.yml`. Supports `--reset` and `--show`. Profile label and modified weights displayed in terminal and HTML report header.
- `core/config.py` — `load_config()`, `get_weights()`, `calculate_weights()`, `is_auto_escalate()`, `get_profile_label()`, `write_config()`.
